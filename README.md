# IndStudy2025
Independent study expanding and elevating research done by myself and a classmate previously

**The Original**
Took research findings regarding the fully homomorphic GGH encryption method prototype; lacked full Quantum Safe encryption, and was not texted using LLL attack methods 

**The update**
Uses LWE encryption method and compresses the encryption image to allow for LLL attack security, and still fully homomorphic, but with additional Gaussian noise, lattice dimensions for 256 encryption ability,and prime a modulus for lattice creation. 



**Requirements for Rough Draft**
pip install pillow
pip install numpy
pip install sympy
pip install tqdm
